# About the Mod
**Music Box** is a Minecraft mod that adds a custom music disc item, allowing you to play any YouTube music in the JukeBox! It is *server compatible*, so you can play music with your friends, add ambient music, create a radio station, and much more!

It is a fork of the Fabric mod [URL Music Discs](https://modrinth.com/mod/url-music-discs), ported to Forge with some improvements and new features.
<br/>

## Dependencies
- [DeltaBox Lib](https://modrinth.com/mod/deltaboxlib)
- [Kotlin For Forge](https://modrinth.com/mod/kotlin-for-forge)

# Features

<br/>

After a disc is saved it can get a random texture out of 40 different variants!
And more to be added in the future!

<br/>

Saving the disc by pressing *esc* will maintain it editable, but if you save it with *enter* it will be locked and signed by you, and can't be edited anymore.

<br/>

If you have a locked disc you want to recycle, you can always use it to craft a fresh new one!

**Secret Features**
<details>
  <summary>Click to reveal</summary>
  You can change the song **Pitch** by ading `&pitch=1.5` at the end of the URL. The pitch value can be any number between 0.5 (scary low) and 2.0 (chipmunk high). The default pitch is 1.0.

  It will only be changed back to the default pitch if you change the pitch to 1.0, as removing the pitch parameter will not change it back to the default pitch.

  Music Box also adds secret music discs that can be obtained in random loot chests, or dropped by mobs. These discs are not craftable, and can only be obtained by luck.

# Future
The mod is still in development, as of now it only works with YouTube links, but I am planning to add support for other platforms like Discord, SoundCloud, and more. If you have any suggestions, or found bugs, please let me know.

New disc variants textures are always welcome if you have new ideas!

**What about a Fabric version?** I'm not planning to make a Fabric version of this mod, but you can use the original mod [URL Music Discs](https://modrinth.com/mod/url-music-discs) that is available for Fabric.
